# contact-lines-on-an-elastic-membrane
This  project contains key codes for our paper "Static interface profiles for contact lines on an elastic membrane".

Files: main.m reshape_droplet.m update_membrane.m move_contactline.m.

Above four parts are combined to be the whole key code for our project.

main.m sets initial parameters of the numerical model and gives the whole structure of the numerical method.

reshape_droplet.m is the function to compute the location of the current droplet using the area constraint and contact angles.

update_membrane.m is the function to form and solve the main linear system in our numerical method to update the configuration of the current membrane.

move_contactline.m is the function to update the contact line position along the membrane.
